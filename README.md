# How AidArcade Works

AidArcade simplifies the process of requesting and offering help through an intuitive platform:

1. **User Registration:**
   - Visitors register as either Helpers (those offering aid) or Seekers (those in need of aid).

2. **Request Submission:**
   - **Seekers** can submit detailed requests for the help they require.
   - These requests are securely processed and stored in our Microsoft SQL Server database.

3. **Centralized Request Dashboard:**
   - **Helpers** have access to a real-time, centralized dashboard showcasing all active requests.
   - This dashboard ensures that Helpers are always up-to-date with the latest information to offer timely assistance.

Our platform is designed to make it as simple as possible for those in need to connect with those who can help, fostering a supportive and responsive community.
